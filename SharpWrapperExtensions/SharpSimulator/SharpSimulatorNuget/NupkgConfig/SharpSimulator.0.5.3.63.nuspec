--- 
### Change Log For Release
- Included some new code changes to bring the newest vesion of the SharpWrap library into this project. 
- Built in changes needed to ensure all VIN reading routines will work when checked via CAN and processed out to the host device using ISO15765. 
- Fixed a couple issues with response times. 
- Performed a pretty big refactor on the whole playback side of this operation so that we can control more components of channel creation and configuration via a UI slightly easier
