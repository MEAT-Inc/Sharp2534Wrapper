## **SharpWrap2534**
- SharpWrap2534 is an approach at trying to build and deploy and easily consumable, user friendly, J2534 API wrapper in C#.    
- As always, pull this version in using the Nuget PM with the command 
  - ` dotnet add PROJECT package SharpWrap2534 --version LATEST `

### Change Log For Release
- Fixed some small issues with PTOpen command routines. Commands were not previously marking if a session was opened correctly or not. 
- Reworked the isOpen and isConnected states for our JInstances to reflect their values based on the channel states and device ID values. 
- Fixed issue with PTClose where device ID was not being reset and thus, the isOpen value was not setting correctly
