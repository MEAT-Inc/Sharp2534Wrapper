## **SharpWrap2534**
- SharpWrap2534 is an approach at trying to build and deploy and easily consumable, user friendly, J2534 API wrapper in C#.    
- As always, pull this version in using the Nuget PM with the command 
  - ` dotnet add PROJECT package SharpWrap2534 --version LATEST `
--- 
### Change Log For Release
- Fixed a small set of issues found during DLL importing routines. 
- These exceptions thrown were taking up a lot of processing time to deal with and were slowing down consuming programs. 
- I've included a set of try/catch blocks to deal with these exceptions before they even make it to our consuming application in hopes that we can stop these slow downs in the future.
