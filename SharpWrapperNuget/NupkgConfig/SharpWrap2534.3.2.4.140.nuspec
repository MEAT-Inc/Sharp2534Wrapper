## **SharpWrap2534**
- SharpWrap2534 is an approach at trying to build and deploy and easily consumable, user friendly, J2534 API wrapper in C#.    
- As always, pull this version in using the Nuget PM with the command 
  - ` dotnet add PROJECT package SharpWrap2534 --version LATEST `
--- 
### Change Log For Release
- Finally got VBattery readouts working. 
- Had an issue with the IOCTL command being issued out. Was not including a Zero Pointer object in the params of the Marshalled out call but now I am. 
- This now fixes the voltage reading issues and allows us to read every pin one by one.
