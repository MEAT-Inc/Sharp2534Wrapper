## **SharpWrap2534**
- SharpWrap2534 is an approach at trying to build and deploy and easily consumable, user friendly, J2534 API wrapper in C#.    
- As always, pull this version in using the Nuget PM with the command 
  - ` dotnet add PROJECT package SharpWrap2534 --version LATEST `
--- 
### Change Log For Release
- Added in a small routine for cleanup when GC is triggered instead of the user calling the cleanup routines. There is no way to ensure these methods are run correctly though.  
- By the time GC comes around, our instance objects may be nulled out already causing a disaster of null ref exceptions possibly. 
- Forcing conditional access to all of the this calls on our dctor routines to work around it hopefully
