## **SharpWrap2534**
- SharpWrap2534 is an approach at trying to build and deploy and easily consumable, user friendly, J2534 API wrapper in C#.    
- As always, pull this version in using the Nuget PM with the command 
  - ` dotnet add PROJECT package SharpWrap2534 --version LATEST `
--- 
### Change Log For Release
- Fixed a bug on session shutdown for the SharpSession where a self refrenced method was invalid since it was called from a CTOR. 
- This has been fixed and wrapped into a try catch block. When this issue was being thrown, all important routines were completed, but the logging commands were failing out. 
- All has been fixed and newly built now.
