## **Installing SharpAutoId**
- SharpWrapper can either be manually imported into a project using the DLLs (and debugging symbols for best results) under the releases page. Or, the package is published on NuGet for easy updates and other support.

    ### Install from PackageManager CLI
  - From the Nuget PackageManager CLI or other NuGet interface, run the following command.  The package itself does not have any third party depenednecies so version conflicts should't be an issue any any point.
    
    ` dotnet add PROJECT package SharpAutoId --version LATEST `
